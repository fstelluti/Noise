# Noise - An audio visualization tool
#### Final computer graphics project for Comp 317 at Concordia University 
##### Completed with a team of 5 people

Noise is an audio visualization tool where a scene of 3D objects are transformed (moved and scaled) at various intensities that are synchronized to the beat of the current song playing. Also, particles are emmited to the beat with certain spherical objects.

Currently, the project contains various cameras used to traverse the scene and view models, several different lighting schemes (including Gouraud and Phong), a cube splitter (a cube that is dynamically cut in half), a full skybox, and environment reflections on certain models.

This project is best descibed with screenshots.
